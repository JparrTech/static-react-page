# React Project To Practice Some New Skills

In this project I strengthened my React development skills, and learned the following:
* Rem font sizing. Rem - Root Em, is relative font sizing to the root element's font size. In short, it allows for scalability and responsive design.
* Using Google fonts in a webpage.
* Flexboxes - I used flexboxes to contain and allign groups of elements. 
* How to use CSS Selectors the right way: Body selector, Asterik (universal) Selector, and selecting children elements.
* Using boarder-box instead of the default content-box model to make layouts easier to work with.
* Padding - When listing the padding on a selected element, the first pixel value is for the top and bottom, and the second for the left and right sides of the container. 
* Using the list item psuedo-selector marker to change the color of bullet points. 
* Adding an image to the background using the CSS background image attribute. 

The majority of what I exercised in this project was CSS skills, paired with some react components. Now that I have a pretty good understanding of CSS,
my future projects will be more focused on leveling my React knowledge.
